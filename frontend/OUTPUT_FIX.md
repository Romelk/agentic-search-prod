# 🎯 **Output Display Issue - FIXED!**

## ❌ **Problem:**
You were absolutely right - we were going in circles! The search was working but **NO RESULTS WERE BEING DISPLAYED**.

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
The ResultsView component existed but wasn't showing the search results properly, leaving users with no visible output.

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### **1. Created SimpleResultsView Component**
- **Visual results display** with proper grid layout
- **Product cards** showing images, prices, and details
- **Bundle information** with coherence scores
- **Debug information** to track what's happening

### **2. Added Debugging Logs**
```typescript
console.log('Results in store:', useSearchStore.getState().results);
console.log('Has results:', useSearchStore.getState().hasResults);
```

### **3. Replaced Complex ResultsView with SimpleResultsView**
- **Temporary fix** to show results immediately
- **Clean, Apple-style design** with proper spacing
- **Responsive grid layout** for different screen sizes
